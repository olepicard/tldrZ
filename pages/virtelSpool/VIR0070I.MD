[VIR0070I SIMULTANEOUS TRANSACTION AT TERMINAL termid](https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuals/virtel/Virtel459MG/messages.html?highlight=VIR0070I#VIR0070I)

`Module`
- 	VIR0010

`Meaning`
- The terminal termid has started a second transaction while the first one was still active.

`Action`
- If the first transaction results in a Multi-Session menu display, VIRTEL maybe did not obtain from VTAM the status of the menu applications (in cross domain for example). If this is the case, remove status control from this application (PF9 from the general Sub-Applications menu).
