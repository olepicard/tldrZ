# VIR0032W BYPASSING LINE n-xxxxxx : DISABLED IN VIRTCT
Module
    VIR0000
Meaning
    The line whose internal name is n-xxxxxx was not activated at VIRTEL startup, either because its name appears in the IGNLU parameter in the VIRTCT, or because your VIRTEL license does not allow the activation of this type of line.
Action
    In the first case, remove the line name from the IGNLU parameter in the VIRTCT. In the second case, contact Syspertec to upgrade your license.
