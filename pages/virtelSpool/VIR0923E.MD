[VIR0923E NO RELAY AVAILABLE FOR termid POOL 'poolname' WITH NAME 'luname’](https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuals/virtel/Virtel459MG/messages.html?highlight=VIR0923E#VIR0923E)

`Module`
- VIR0009

`Meaning`
- Terminal termid could not allocate the LU luname required by the incoming call because pool poolname does not contain the relay luname.

`Action`
- Check the definitions of terminal termid and pool poolname (F2 from the configuration menu, or F5 from the sub-application system services menu). Check the definition of the rule which matched the incoming call. The relay specified in the “Parameter” field of the rule must exist in the pool.
