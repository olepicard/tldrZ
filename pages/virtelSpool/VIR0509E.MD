`Module`
- VIR0005

`Meaning`
- A call to server servname from terminal termid failed because the called number is blank or non-numeric.

`Action`
- Check the definition of external server servname. Check that the “Number” field is valid (see “External Servers” in the VIRTEL Connectivity Reference manual). If the value of the “Number” field is blank or “=”, check the called number supplied by the application (CFT, Inter.PEL, STI) which initiated the call. In the case of a VIRKIX application, check that the entry point has a “Mirror” transaction as the first transaction.
