# VIRI907I luname(termid) REJECTED BIND FROM applname
Module
    VIR0I09
Meaning
    The relay LU luname associated with VIRTEL terminal termid received an unsolicited SNA BIND command from application applname. VIRTEL rejected the BIND because the LU was not expecting to receive a session request from applname. This can occur if a PCNE application is attempting to place an outgoing call to an LU reserved for incoming calls.
Action
    Check that the application has specified the correct LU name. Check that “possible calls” is not set to “2” in the VIRTEL terminal definition.
