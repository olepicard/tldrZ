[VIR0861I MIXED-CASE PASSWORD SUPPORT IS ACTIVE](https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuals/virtel/Virtel459MG/messages.html?highlight=VIR0861I#VIR0861I)

`Module`
- Security

`Meaning`
- The security manager (RACF or compatible sub-system) has indicated to VIRTEL that it supports lower-case characters in passwords. Consequently VIRTEL will pass passwords to the security manager exactly as entered by the user, without translating them to upper case.

`Action`
- None.
