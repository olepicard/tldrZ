[VIR0086E GETMAIN FAILED. MEMORY DSA DISABLED](https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuals/virtel/Virtel459MG/messages.html?highlight=VIR0086E#VIR0086E)

`Module`
- 	VIR0000

`Meaning`
- 	Virtel was unable to GETMAIN storage “above the BAR” for the DSA table.

`Action`
- Increase MEMLIMIT= in the JCL to provide more “above the BAR” storage. Virtel continues but you should contact support if the problem continues. Suggest a default of MEMLIMIT=2G.
