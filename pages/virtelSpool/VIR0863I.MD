`Meaning`
- The user has defined the MIXEDCASE subparameter in the SECUR TCT keyword. This indicates to VIRTEL that it should support lower-case characters in passwords. Consequently VIRTEL will pass passwords to the security manager exactly as entered by the user, without translating them to upper case.

`Action`
- None.
