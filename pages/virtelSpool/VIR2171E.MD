`Module`
- VIR0021G

`Meaning`
- Entry point epname has no transaction whose “Logon message” field matches the preconnection message of an incoming X25 call, and VIRTEL cannot send an error message to the terminal because there is no transaction with external name USSMSG01. The call is cleared.

`Action`
- Define a transaction with external name USSMSG01 under entry point epname. See the description of VIR0021G in the VIRTEL Connectivity Reference manual.
