`Module`
- VIR0009

`Meaning`
- Terminal termid attempted to connect, but there is no active relay in pool poolname, or all the relays in the pool are in use, or there is no available relay with the specified prefix. The connection is refused by VIRTEL.

`Action`
- Check that the VTAM node containing the relays is activated. Increase the number of relays in the pool poolname.  If the message contains a PREFIX then there is a conflict between the prefix specified in the transaction and the terminal names of the relays in the pool.
